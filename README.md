# Robocup
RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation League, written in Python, for my A.I. class project. 

In case you're wondering, this won the class tournament, but its positioning is shitty tho.


## Installation

Clone this repo:
```
git clone <git-url>
```

Assuming you have `rcsoccersim` on your machine, run it first. Then run the AI agent optionally with a teamname prepended.

```
rcsoccersim
[TEAM=<NAME>] python main.py
```


## Development

`aigent/aima_python/` is just for reference - that's the sample code from Norvig's *Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach*.

`aigent/soccerpy/` contains the source for the agent and client. This is sourced from [jsontbradshaw/soccerpy](https://github.com/jasontbradshaw/soccerpy) under the MIT license. I've modified it to add several convenient methods, but minimal modification within this folder is needed.

`aigent/agent_*.py` is the real deal - it lets you configure different agent personalities and stategies. For example you can have striker, defender, goalie agents, which are `agent_1`, `agent_2` and `agent_3` respectively.

Once you have the agents, you can import a distribution of them, assign them player numbers and configure their starting positions in `main.py`. This is also the file you run to play.

## Notes
Below are my notes containing strategies I used, and ideas I had no time to implement.


#### kickoff
act if it's your team's ball.
`is_before_kick_off() && is_kick_off_us()`

#### whistle
Throw in, free kick, penalty, goalkick
BEFORE_KICK_OFF = "before_kick_off"
PLAY_ON = "play_on"
TIME_OVER = "time_over"
KICK_OFF_L = "kick_off_l"
KICK_OFF_R = "kick_off_r"
KICK_IN_L = "kick_in_l"
KICK_IN_R = "kick_in_r"
FREE_KICK_L = "free_kick_l"
FREE_KICK_R = "free_kick_r"
CORNER_KICK_L = "corner_kick_l"
CORNER_KICK_R = "corner_kick_r"
GOAL_KICK_L = "goal_kick_l"
GOAL_KICK_R = "goal_kick_r"
DROP_BALL = "drop_ball"
OFFSIDE_L = "offside_l"
OFFSIDE_R = "offside_r"

#### offense
When your team has the ball.
- advance: if not close enuf
- shoot: if close enuf and clear

#### defense
When ball is in your half of the field, and enemy's possession
- just swarm them for now

#### player maneuver
block, evades


####  Neural Net
on top of predefined conditional actions and heuristics

Fields, per robot
want: input = conditions, output = actions

env input:
- distance to goal
- distance to ball
- distance to enemy
- distance to teammate

output actions:
- shoot to goal (scoring is the whole point of the game)
- pass to teammate
- run to position (ball, teammate, enemy, side)

unsupervised pretraining on autoencoder:
- output = input, i.e. input env conds

supervised training:
- set {env, actions} collected in the last round of game, only if result is positive


First define ur env vars n simple heuristics

or skip the pretraining by using a random net first, plug in net n repeat

run a game, each think step collect data of outcome n prev actions, inject to db.
game ends, train autoencoder w/ all actions, then train real
plug in the net, repeat above for evolution

where to incorp action success: reward n cost? in selection of data, by evolution n natural selection
